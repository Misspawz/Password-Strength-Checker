#The Password Strength Checker is a Python script that evaluates the strength of a given password based on various criteria and provides feedback on how to improve it. The script assesses the password's length, character variety (including uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters), and additional complexity factors.

Features
Length Check: Ensures the password is at least 8 characters long.
Uppercase Check: Requires at least one uppercase letter.
Lowercase Check: Requires at least one lowercase letter.
Digit Check: Requires at least one digit.
Special Character Check: Requires at least one special character.
Complexity Checks: Includes checks for mixed case, consecutive characters, and a common pattern.
Requirements
Python 3.x
The re and string modules (part of Python's standard library)
Installation
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.

No additional installation is required for this script since it uses standard Python libraries.

Usage
Save the script to a file, e.g., password_checker.py.

Run the script using Python:
python password_checker.py
When prompted, enter the password you want to check.

The script will output a message indicating the strength of the password and provide feedback if it doesn't meet certain criteria.

Example
Enter your password: MySecureP@ssw0rd
Strong password
Feedback Categories
Very weak password: The password does not meet the minimum strength criteria.
Weak password: The password meets some criteria but lacks other important features.
Medium password: The password meets most criteria but could be improved.
Strong password: The password meets all required criteria.
Very strong password: The password is robust and secure.
Code Explanation
Basic Criteria: Checks the length and character types (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters).
Additional Complexity Checks: Includes checks for mixed case, consecutive characters, and common patterns to ensure the password is not easily guessable.
